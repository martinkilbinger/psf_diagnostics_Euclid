# PSF diagnostics for Euclid

## Test data

A test set of simulated stars and PSF modelled with WaveDiff is included in `data/test`. The PSF run corresponds to `wf-outputs-202307211844`.
- `Euclid_rho_input.fits`

   WaveDiff output columns required for rho stats, extracted from WaveDiff output.

- test_metric.npy, WaveDiff output. If you want to use this file, copy it from `/feynman/work/dap/lcs/jw274171/Euclid/jw-psf/wf-outputs-success/wf-outputs-202307211844/metrics/test_metric.npy` .

  To create this file, use wave diff fork  https://github.com/Jeanne-jw/wf-psf .
